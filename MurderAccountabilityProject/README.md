# Murder Accountability Project Fork

This space is meant to serve as an initial open-source space for a collection of scripts and tools for open-source use.

They aim to aid in the analysis of the murder accountability project's datasets. This space is evolving fast, a few upgrades in the works:

- Agent integration for in-depth feature engineering and ML layer integrations.
- Three.js globe visualization with multi-layer data graphic filters.
- Law enforcement cooperation through live agent development and monitoring (following BOLA wrap model, currently not available to the public)
