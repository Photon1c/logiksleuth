# Logiksleuth
20Qs, CLUE and Guess Who all rolled up into one suite of scripts aimed at deploying a process of elimination 


# Introduction: Now in Development
Logiksleuth is an app that aims to make the process of elimination a machine learnable task which can help elucidate
blind spots to end users. It takes a lesson from games like 20 Questions, CLUE, and Guess Who to arrive at the
most probablty answer given a set of clearly defined inputs to start from. 

Initially an examples folder will be created to demonstrate the ideal state that LogikSleuth will achieve once
it is fully deployed. This repository is a collection of gradual commits.
