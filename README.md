# 🔍 Logiksleuth 🔎 

*Now audited with Cursor and Cloudflare agents 🤖☁️*  

8.17.25 Update: The [Murder Accountability Project](https://github.com/Photon1c/logiksleuth/tree/main/MurderAccountabilityProject) fork with add-ons is now available. It provides a basic CLI to interfact with the FBI's UCR datasets spanning decades, filtering cases by closed, active, or other customizable statuses.   

# /examples 

The /examples directory contains simple starting scripts that use well-known board games to establish a logic structure.

20Qs, CLUE and Guess Who all rolled up into one suite of scripts aimed at deploying a process of elimination to a host of models, check back later for updates as this project grows. Most of the files associated with this project have not been made public yet since they are in development.




# Introduction: Now in Development
Logiksleuth is collection of scripts that aim to make the process of elimination a machine learnable task, which can potentially elucidate
blind spots to end users. The initial sample scripts take a lesson from games like 20 Questions, CLUE, and Guess Who to arrive at the
most probable answer given a set of clearly defined inputs to start from. 

Initially an examples folder will be created to demonstrate the ideal state that LogikSleuth will achieve once
it is fully deployed, starting from a few basic python scripts and their respective jupyter notebooks. 

The galton board function is a useful baseline to build more complex predictive models. The work in progress "Ghost of Poirot" aims to use
the Murder Accountability Projects' data sets and methodology to formalize a programmatic approach to cold case solving. Check back later as
scripts ready to be released publicly are published.

Update June 2023: The citations_generator script can be used to maintain a reliable database of sources to use in bibliographies.

Update August 2025: The Murder Accountability Add-On Fork has a CLI used to traverse the sea of data available through the project. It is in active development as dashboards and report generators are added to the future version pipeline. Check back ask this repository is updated!

<summary>Enhanced Project Vision</summary>  
  
As Cursor and Cloudflare agents behind to paratroop down and upgrade this repository, the following vision has been considered an interesting challenge to take on as this meta project takes shape:

"Criticality of Eruptive Events: Applying Reflexive Engine Dynamics to Reinforcement Learning Algorithms"

Description

This work explores how eruptive events—sudden ruptures in complex systems such as markets, ecosystems, or social structures—can be modeled through reflexive engine dynamics and integrated into reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks. By treating volatility and feedback loops as criticality thresholds rather than noise, the study aims to:

Identify eruption points where small perturbations cascade into large-scale systemic shifts.

Map reflexive feedback cycles (self-reinforcing or self-correcting) into the state-action space of RL agents.

Develop algorithms that not only adapt to environmental dynamics but also anticipate rupture zones and adjust strategies preemptively.

The result is a methodology that equips RL systems with criticality awareness—an ability to recognize when they are approaching points of instability and to leverage or avoid them. Applications range from financial market modeling and risk defense systems, to resilience planning in ecological and infrastructural networks, and to adaptive AI systems capable of self-regulation under stress.
