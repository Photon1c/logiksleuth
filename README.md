# Logiksleuth
20Qs, CLUE and Guess Who all rolled up into one suite of scripts aimed at deploying a process of elimination 


# Introduction: Now in Development
Logiksleuth is collection of scripts that aim to make the process of elimination a machine learnable task, which can potentially elucidate
blind spots to end users. The initial sample scripts take a lesson from games like 20 Questions, CLUE, and Guess Who to arrive at the
most probable answer given a set of clearly defined inputs to start from. 

Initially an examples folder will be created to demonstrate the ideal state that LogikSleuth will achieve once
it is fully deployed. This repository is a collection of gradual commits.

The galton board function is a useful baseling to build more complex predictive models. The work in progress "Ghost of Poirot" aims to use
the Murder Accountability Projects' data sets and methodology to formalize a programmatic approach to cold case solving.
