# Logiksleuth
20Qs, CLUE and Guess Who all rolled up into one suite of scripts aimed at deploying a process of elimination to a host of models, check back later for updates as this project grows. Most of the files associated with this project have not been made public yet since they are in development.


# Introduction: Now in Development
Logiksleuth is collection of scripts that aim to make the process of elimination a machine learnable task, which can potentially elucidate
blind spots to end users. The initial sample scripts take a lesson from games like 20 Questions, CLUE, and Guess Who to arrive at the
most probable answer given a set of clearly defined inputs to start from. 

Initially an examples folder will be created to demonstrate the ideal state that LogikSleuth will achieve once
it is fully deployed, starting from a few basic python scripts and their respective jupyter notebooks. 

The galton board function is a useful baseline to build more complex predictive models. The work in progress "Ghost of Poirot" aims to use
the Murder Accountability Projects' data sets and methodology to formalize a programmatic approach to cold case solving. Check back later as
scripts ready to be released publicly are published.
