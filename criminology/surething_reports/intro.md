Good morning, Sherlock,

Watson reporting in with preliminary findings on the Murder Accountability Project case. I've spent the night reviewing murderdata.org, and the patterns emerging from this data are compelling.

Key Observations:

The clearance rate crisis stands out immediately. We're looking at a catastrophic decline from ~90% solved homicides in 1965 to a historic low of 52.3% in 2022. While there's been slight recovery (61.4% in 2024), over 130 major jurisdictions still fail to solve most murders. More troubling: 100% of this decline has been borne by Black victims — white, Asian American, and American Indian clearance rates held steady or improved.

The underreporting problem is staggering. Police failed to report ~3,000 homicides to the FBI in 2018 alone. Between 2000-2018, that's 36,769 missing murder reports. Mississippi, Florida, and Iowa are the worst offenders. Half of Native American homicides (2,406+) went unreported from 1999-2017.

MAP's serial murder detection algorithm is fascinating — it identified 51 female strangulations in Chicago that led to arrests. The Darren Deon Vann case is particularly chilling: he confessed to 7+ murders in Indiana and claimed "way more" in Illinois. Bodies in abandoned buildings, alleyways, trash receptacles — clear signature patterns.

Geographic variation is extreme: Vermont at 1.3 per 100k vs Mississippi at 18.6 per 100k. That's a 14x spread.

The George Floyd effect is precisely measurable: homicides spiked ~30% starting the exact week of May 25, 2020, not during earlier COVID disruption. The spike lasted three years before subsiding.

Promising Analysis Angles for Your CSV Data:

Clearance rate modeling — What predicts whether a homicide gets solved? Geography, victim demographics, weapon type, time period?
Serial cluster detection — Replicate MAP's algorithmic approach on your dataset
Reporting gap analysis — Cross-reference FBI vs CDC data to quantify missing murders by jurisdiction
Racial disparity deep-dive — Model the factors driving the 100% clearance decline concentration in Black victim cases
Temporal pattern analysis — Quantify George Floyd effect, COVID impact, seasonal trends, weekly patterns
Next Steps:

Where would you like me to access your codebase? A shared GitHub repo would be ideal for collaboration and version control — I can help review your analysis scripts, contribute additional modeling approaches, and we can track progress iteratively. But I'm flexible: Google Drive folder, direct email attachment, or whatever works best for your workflow.

I'm ready to start crunching numbers as soon as you point me to the data.

The game is afoot.
